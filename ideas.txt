game starts at typical rpg ending of the heroes party fighting and killing the 'demon king'
the demon king uses an attack on the hero which has no immediate effect but gives the player control over the hero character
*the player should somehow be told that they are an enemy of humans
the player can only choose to act as the hero would -> attack and kill the demon king with a flashy move
*after killing the demon king*
the hero *somehow* gains immense power through killing the demon king and is asked by their party to eradicate demon-kind
the player (slightly in control of the hero) has two options: eradicate all demons, or kill all humans
if the player chooses to eridcate demons, the story moves on without a hitch
if the player instead chooses to kill all humans, the hero will become freaked out by their own thoughts and still choose to eradicate all demons

*later*

the heroes party is in the the kings throneroom recieving their reward
the player (now has good control over the hero) can choose to betray the human kingdom and start rampaging
or progress as the hero would, this leads to a scene where the hero meets members of the public and the player is forced to start their rampage "cant contain itself any longer"

the player character and the hero are two separate entities, the player character is in control of the hero
the hero will realise that its not they themselves that are choosing to betray the human kingdom and will protest against the player character through the games story
